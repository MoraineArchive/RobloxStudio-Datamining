# Roblox Studio Datamining

Long-term public archive of independently observed Windows Studio builds, API metadata, readable public source, native metadata, LIVE settings and public web assets. The extractor never launches Roblox.

## Historical datamining

Browse by year:

- [2026](2026/)

Later years (`2027/`, `2028/`, ...) will appear directly at the repository root the same way, alongside `2026/`, as they happen — never nested under an `archive/` wrapper.

### What each top-level thing is

- **`2026/`** (and later years) — historical observed events by month/day/time: `YYYY/MM/DD/HH-MM-SSZ_<event>/`. `2026/09/07/BASELINE/` is the initial repository baseline, not a Roblox update.
- **`current/`** — complete current extracted state. Modified in place on every real upstream change.
- **`LATEST.md`** — the most recent event, or the baseline before any post-publication event exists.
- **`dataminer/`** — implementation of the automated datamining engine (`src/`, `tests/`, `tools/`).
- **Git history** — exact previous contents and line-level source diffs. `2026/.../<event>/` never stores a full copy of a canonical tree; Git already preserves that.

## Readable Studio source

Public Studio artifacts currently expose readable Lua/Luau source in areas including Plugins and LuaPackages. Original readable text is tracked under [current/Plugins](current/Plugins/) and [current/LuaPackages](current/LuaPackages/) with upstream formatting, names and developer comments preserved exactly as retrieved — except BOM removal and LF normalization. Nothing here renames local variables, strips or regenerates comments, prettifies source unnecessarily, or rewrites identifiers. Compiled Source fields are identified separately and are never presented as original source.

## Surfaces

- [Build](current/Build/) — version, packages and file manifest.
- [API](current/API/) — regular/full API dumps and semantic API changes.
- [Plugins](current/Plugins/) and [LuaPackages](current/LuaPackages/) — readable source, model hierarchy, localization and explicit compiled-script metadata.
- [Native](current/Native/) — static analysis of `RobloxStudioBeta.exe`, retained as text; the executable stays in the ignored cache.
- [FastVariables](current/FastVariables/) — C++ literal identifiers and Lua observations kept separate from LIVE values.
- [LiveSettings](current/LiveSettings/) — current `PCStudioApp` values, checked independently of the build GUID.
- [Web](current/Web/) — public JavaScript discovered from configured Studio pages.
- [Provenance](current/Provenance/) — surface identities, source URLs and SHA-256 hashes.

## Run locally

Node.js 24 or newer is required. The implementation lives in [`dataminer/`](dataminer/); commands are documented from the repository root:

```powershell
npm ci --prefix dataminer
npm --prefix dataminer run typecheck
npm --prefix dataminer test
npm --prefix dataminer run check
```

(Equivalently, `cd dataminer` and drop `--prefix dataminer`/`npm --prefix dataminer`.) The generated data always lands at the repository root — `current/`, `2026/`, `LATEST.md`, `events.jsonl` — never inside `dataminer/`.

Run `npm --prefix dataminer run check` again to verify a no-op. No observable change means no new year/month/day directory, no `LATEST.md` rewrite, and no commit. A run containing a new build and its related surfaces creates one build event. Independent changes later that day create additional events — a GitHub Actions workflow ([.github/workflows/datamine.yml](.github/workflows/datamine.yml)) runs this every 15 minutes and commits/pushes only when something real changed.

The summary convention is fixed everywhere — `LATEST.md`, event `summary.md`/`diff.md`/`findings.md`, CLI output, commit bodies: `+` added, `~` changed, `-` removed. Machine-readable JSON uses `added`, `changed` and `removed` fields.

The presence of an identifier, flag, source module, API, string, endpoint, configuration value or other artifact does not confirm that a feature is enabled, publicly available, or planned for release.

## Security and contributions

Read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) before reporting sensitive material. Contributions should preserve provenance, deterministic output and the distinction between observed artifacts and confirmed features.
